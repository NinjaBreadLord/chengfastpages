# MC Reflection + Corrections

## Score 34/39
* A 34/39 is great. For this test I felt like it took a bit longer but was easier. The longer bits of code especially to do with the 2D arrays were more difficult for me. One question on the binary sorting kind of messed me up, but aside from that I think that most of my issues were small mistakes

### Question 7

* I interptreted the code completely wrong for this problem, the outer loop iterates about 6 times and then slowly prints even numbers from 1-6 and decrements as it it continues. 

### Question 14

* Misinterpreted the answer, a and b would have equal values, not a and c. 

### Question 18

* I have to remember that there are no float decimal values when casted as an integer - 404/10 would equal 40, then * 10 would be 400 + 1 = 401. There is no 405. 

### Question 34

* Apparently the size of an array in this AP exam is now beginning from 1, so subtracting 1 is unecessary. Dumb mistake. 

### Question 36

* The correct answer would be 11 - it iterates through 2000 elements and to reach 1 there would be about 11 splits. This was a simple mistake in answering the question, 20 is literally impossible for a list of 2000.
