# MC Reflection + Corrections

## Score 34/39
* A 34/39 is great. For this test I felt like it took a bit longer but was easier. The longer bits of code especially to do with the 2D arrays were more difficult for me. One question on the binary sorting kind of messed me up, but aside from that I think that most of my issues were small mistakes.
