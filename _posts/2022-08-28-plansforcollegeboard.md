## Capturing information from Collegeboard
- With Collegeboard's 10 units I hope to capture most of the information from there onto JupyterNotebook. With each CollegeBoard unit I plan on creating a seperate notebook entailing all the information and details. For certain units I may try and apply that using the kernels on each notebooks
- For FRQs I believe that a similar method should be used, I'll likely organize frq questions into seperate folders with code answering the questions. 

## Recognizing Collegeboard vs PBL
- Continuing off of what I stated before, I hope to have seperate folders and tags(WIP) for Collegeboard materials and information.
- PBL will be placed in a seperate folder and tagging system.
