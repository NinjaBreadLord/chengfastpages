# MC Reflection + Corrections

## Score 54/40 
* Honestly a 54 out of 66 is fine with me. However, I hope that my timing improves and thinking may speed up. Since starting, it took me around two hours to complete the entire thing. For most of the questions I had to use a pen and paper to consider each process, and then really think about it. Seeing how I got a 54/66 with the amount of time I put in, I think that I should really be doing better. I think my main problem is learning to understand large pieces of code(as in putting missing pieces or analyzing certain lines), and I hope that I may focus on that aspect in future tests.

### Question 1

* In this case none of the options work at all, num and j are incorrect varaibles thus options two and three are incorrect. E would be the more fitting answer

### Question 2

* There is no need to change the substring if statement. On the for loop it should not be an equal sign as it would not iterate properly so that the code would be incorrect. A would be the best answer for this case. 

### Question 12

* Or statements would not match the code. Having an or between both statements and ands within the statements would work better, thus making A would be better. 

### Question 25

* No return type was provided for updateItems, because of this the method should be void and does not compile. 

### Question 34 (Review)

* The selected answer of A would be wrong as the sum would be twice as large as the correct answer. D would compile correctly. 

### Question 36

* The answer is C. Line 5 didn't cause an error.

### Question 39

* 2001 is not divisible by four, thus making my selected answer wrong. 1900 would work better. 

### Question 41

* I got messed up with the math here. B is the correct answer.

### Question 58
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89239598/214118753-4e0578bf-d19c-426c-8174-6387f9207edd.png)
* I literally misread the answer and put the wrong change in variable. It should be int pos = j;
