# MC Reflection + Corrections

## Score 43/52 
* A 43/52 is fine with me. However, I hope that my timing improves and thinking may speed up. Since starting, it took me around two hours to complete the entire thing. For most of the questions I had to use a pen and paper to consider each process, and then really think about it. Seeing how I got a 43/52 with the amount of time I put in, I think that I should really be doing better. I think my main problem is learning to understand large pieces of code(as in putting missing pieces or analyzing certain lines), and I hope that I may focus on that aspect in future tests.

### Question 2

* Misinterpreted the 2d array cell, ```mat[1][3]``` assigns 4, but there are also other cells. 

### Question 7

* Selected option (E) would be incorrect as it does not combine the two binary strings together, B actually represents the combined string properly.

### Question 12

* Although the first line of "Alex Bob Carl" is proper, the second line doesn't repeat itself. The second row would set all the names as "Alex" thus D is correct. 

### Question 20

* The character "!" would actually be printed 6 times, my selected answer of 4 would be correct if it was printed in all of the array. 

### Question 21

* Miscalculated the looping, it would actually be 5 instead of 4. 

### Question 26

* "On" is not a palindrome thus would not be equal to itself printed backwards. "noon" would be much more fitting as it is a palindrome 

### Question 23 (Review)

* Here baboon would actually be inserted at the end of the array list as it begins with the letter 'b' and will be added at size-k which is at the end. From there, my order is correct in "bear" following "zebra" etc. I think I had a little trouble understanding the substring and remove commands, and thus need to look at it more in depth. 

### Question 35

* Just a case of reading the code improperly. Interpreted as printing at index k which would be incorrect. 

### Question 42

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89239598/215838706-382fe626-2476-4014-afe9-7b5abe55e49b.png)

* 0 would be included in this array, I was close but just forgot one integer. 

### Question 50

* Read loop text wrong. C would be right
