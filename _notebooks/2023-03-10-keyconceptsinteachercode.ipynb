    "### Methods and Control structures\n",
    "* Methods in overall coding are blocks of code that can be called upon and reused when needed within anywhere of the code. \n",
    "* When defining methods, one should be aware of the variable type that the method would return, parameters it takes in, of course the code, and then its implementation in calling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Types\n",
    "* Data types in Java are different values that could be stored in a variable in Java. As far as it goes, there are primitive data types and non primitive.\n"

    "### Looking at the Diverse Arrays/Matrix \n",

    "\n",
    "* Within Mort's code he defines various methods within the Diverse array class, beginning with the arraySum method. It takes in an array, and finds the sum of the integers in the array. \n",
