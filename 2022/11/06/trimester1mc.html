<ul>
  <li>Honestly a 32 out of 40 is fine with me, it barely makes the cutoff for a an 80%. However, I hope that my timing improves and thinking may speed up. Since starting, it took me around two hours to complete the entire thing. For most of the questions I had to use a pen and paper to consider each process, and then really think about it. Seeing how I got a 32/40 with the amount of time I put in, I think that I should really be doing better. I think my main problem is learning to understand large pieces of code(as in putting missing pieces or analyzing certain lines), and I hope that I may focus on that aspect in future tests.</li>

<h3 id="question-4">Question 4</h3>

<ul>
  <li>I incorrectly chose the floated value instead of the value that fits the integer primitive. The answer 2.333 should be rounded down to 2.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="question-10">Question 10</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Choice 1(A) would actually work as it returns value 0 from the function seqSearchRecHelper. Choice 2(B) would be the correct answer as if the data does contain the value 5, the function would instead return -1 creating an out of bounds error.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="question-14">Question 14</h3>

<p>image.png</p>

<ul>
  <li>Because of the usage of an enhanced for each loop, there is no need for the method .get does not need to be used making answer choice D wrong. v.getMileage() would be better as it only uses the variable “v” and nothing else, which is the proper way in using an enhanced loop.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="question-15">Question 15</h3>

<p>image.png</p>

<ul>
  <li>My selected answer(D) is incorrect because choice two does not work. Choice two provides data[k + 1] which would create an out of bounds error on the last part of the array. Choice 1 is correct, and therefore choice A would be correct.</li>
</ul>
